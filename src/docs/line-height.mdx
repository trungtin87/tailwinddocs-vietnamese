## Ví dụ

### Ví dụ cơ bản

Sử dụng các tiện ích font size như `text-sm/6` và `text-lg/7` để đặt font size và line-height của một phần tử cùng một lúc:

<Figure>

<Example>{
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-8">
    <div>
      <span className="mb-3 font-mono text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">text-sm/6</span>
      <p className="text-sm/6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
        So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
        my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship
        of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span className="mb-3 font-mono text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">text-sm/7</span>
      <p className="text-sm/7 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
        So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
        my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship
        of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span className="mb-3 font-mono text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">text-sm/8</span>
      <p className="text-sm/8 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
        So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
        my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship
        of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
      </p>
    </div>

  </div>
}</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:text-base/6,text-base/7,text-base/8] -->
<p class="text-base/6 ...">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
<p class="text-base/7 ...">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
<p class="text-base/8 ...">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

</Figure>

Mỗi tiện ích font size cũng đặt một line height mặc định khi không được cung cấp. Bạn có thể tìm hiểu thêm về các giá trị này và cách tùy chỉnh chúng trong [tài liệu font-size](/docs/font-size).

### Đặt độc lập

Sử dụng các tiện ích `leading-<number>` như `leading-6` và `leading-7` để đặt line height của một phần tử độc lập với font-size:

<Figure>

<Example>
  {
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-8">
      <div>
        <span className="mb-3 font-mono text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">leading-6</span>
        <p className="leading-6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
          So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
          my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the
          kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <span className="mb-3 font-mono text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">leading-7</span>
        <p className="leading-7 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
          So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
          my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the
          kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <span className="mb-3 font-mono text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">leading-8</span>
        <p className="leading-8 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
          So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
          my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the
          kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:leading-6,leading-7,leading-8] -->
<p class="text-sm leading-6">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
<p class="text-sm leading-7">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
<p class="text-sm leading-8">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```

</Figure>

### Loại bỏ leading

Sử dụng tiện ích `leading-none` để đặt line height của một phần tử bằng với font size của nó:

<Figure>

<Example>
  {
    <p className="mx-auto max-w-2xs text-2xl leading-none text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
      The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    </p>
  }
</Example>

```html
<!-- [!code classes:leading-none] -->
<p class="text-2xl leading-none ...">The quick brown fox...</p>
```

</Figure>

### Sử dụng giá trị tùy chỉnh

<UsingACustomValue element="p" utility="leading" name="line height" variable="line-height" value="1.5" />

### Responsive design

<ResponsiveDesign element="p" property="line-height" defaultClass="leading-5" featuredClass="leading-6" />

## Tùy chỉnh theme của bạn

<CustomizingYourSpacingScale utility="leading" />
